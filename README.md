# Car Simulator

**3D Car Simulator** game written in `C++`, using `GLFW`, `GLM` and `GLSL` libraries, along with `GFX Framework`.

The gameplay component is not implemented. The project only aims to simulate the physics of driving a car, collisions with other cars or the exterior of the road.

## How to play

Just open the `.exe` file in the `\bin\Debug` folder and make sure you have all the necessary DLLs installed. It it doesn't work, build the project with `CMake` and compile it manually.
